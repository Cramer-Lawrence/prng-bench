## üöÄ Overview

`qprng-bench` is a C++ benchmarking suite designed to evaluate both **performance** and **distribution quality** across various pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithms under different threading models. It's engineered with **thread-local vs shared vs single-threaded** configurations to showcase real-world performance differences, particularly in multithreaded Quant Dev contexts.

**PRNGs Benchmarked:**
- Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)
- Mersenne Twister (MT19937)
- PCG32
- SplitMix64
- XOR Shift

Each is tested across a configurable range of iteration sizes and thread counts, then profiled for:
- Execution time
- Distribution deviation (average + max deviation from uniformity)

## üí° Key Takeaways

- Thread-local PRNGs are optimal in terms of both speed and distribution.
- Shared PRNGs, while safe (via mutex or atomic wrapping), perform drastically worse.
- Distribution anomalies surfaced during initial runs were likely caused by non-thread-safe sharing.
- Spikes in data were traced to system load interference and resolved by adding `std::this_thread::sleep_for`.

## ‚úÖ Skills Demonstrated

- Modern C++: smart pointers, RAII, mutex/thread_local/thread join
- Multithreaded benchmarking + CSV export
- Uniformity measurement of PRNGs
- Use of CLI11 for argument parsing
- GitHub-ready documentation and visualizations

## üß† Lessons Learned

- Thread safety has serious performance tradeoffs in PRNG scenarios.
- Even simple random algorithms have complex behavior under stress.
- Benchmarking requires clean testing environments to avoid noise.
- Visualizations matter‚Äîclear graphs tell a much better story than raw data.
